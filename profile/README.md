Welcome to the **Bristol Hydrology Group**! We explore the behaviour and role of water in the environment, investigating how hydrological systems respond to environmental change‚Äîpast, present, and future. We focus on the development and application of hydraulic models, as well as the assimilation of observational data with such models to support flood risk assessment and management at global, national, and regional scales under climate change.

## üåä Our Research Themes

- **Flood Risk & Drought Modelling**  
  Global and national-scale assessment of flood and drought hazards.

- **Dryland Hydro‚ÄêClimatology**  
  Dynamics of water in arid and semi-arid landscapes.

- **Biogeochemical Fluxes**  
  Nature, origins, and ecological impacts of contaminants in:
  - Freshwaters
  - Estuaries
  - Coastal zones
